# MIPS
This is my collection of programs created using MIPS Mars Simulator
# Range.asm
This program prints out a range of numbers between two user given input
# Compress.asm
This program takes in strings and compresses the string down to a char + count format<br/>
Example [ Input -> {AAAAAABBBBAAAA} : Output -> {A6 B4 A4} ]
# Grid.asm
This will take two user input for number of Rows [N] and number of columns [M] and print a grid of 1's and 0's <br/>
Example [ Input -> N = 4, M = 5 ]<br/>
[Output]<br/>
11111<br/>
10101<br/>
11011<br/>
11111<br/>
# Directory 
This uses predefined nodes with employee name, number, and age, along with pointers to next nodes (Singly-linked) and takes in a keyword to pull information on desired employees<br/>
[WIP] Still needs to be configured to compare node data for desired output
