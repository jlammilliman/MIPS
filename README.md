# MIPS
This is my collection of programs created using MIPS Mars Simulator
# Range.asm
This program prints out a range of nubmers between two user given input
# Compress.asm
This program takes in strings and compresses the string down to a char + count format
Example [ Input -> {AAAAAABBBBAAAA} : Output -> {A6 B4 A4} ]
# Grid.asm
This will take two user input for number of Rows [N] and number of columns [M] and print a grid of 1's and 0's
\nExample [ Input -> N = 4, M = 5 ]
\n[Output]
\n11111
\n10101
\n11011
\n11111
# Directory 
This uses predefined nodes with employee name, number, and age, along with pointers to next nodes (Singly-linked) and takes in a keyword to pull information on desired employees
[WIP] Still needs to be configured to search nodes
